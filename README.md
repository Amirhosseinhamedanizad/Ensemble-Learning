Elevating Whale Sound Classification with Ensemble Learning: Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking

Title:
         "Elevating Whale Sound Classification with Ensemble Learning: Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking"

Summary:
        This project employs a formidable ensemble learning strategy to enhance the accuracy of whale sound classification. Leveraging the combined strengths of Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking ensemble techniques, a diverse set of base classifiers, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, work collaboratively to provide highly precise predictions. The ensemble models achieved remarkable accuracy, underscoring their efficacy in discerning between whale and non-whale sounds with remarkable precision.

        Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking are powerful ensemble learning techniques used to enhance the performance of machine learning models. Bagging, represented by algorithms like Random Forest, leverages multiple base models trained on different subsets of the data and aggregates their predictions, reducing overfitting and improving robustness. Boosting, exemplified by AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting, iteratively adjusts the weights of data points to emphasize challenging samples, thereby refining the model's predictive accuracy. Stacking takes ensemble learning further by combining predictions from diverse base models, effectively creating a meta-model, which can capture complex patterns in the data, leading to superior predictive capabilities. These techniques collectively enable more accurate and robust machine learning models.
